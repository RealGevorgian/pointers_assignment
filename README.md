Pointers Assignment Repository

   This repository contains solutions for a series of C programming assignments focused on understanding and implementing pointers. Each assignment demonstrates different aspects of pointer usage in C, including basic pointer operations, pointer arithmetic, passing pointers to functions, double pointers, and string manipulation with character pointers.
