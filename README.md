# Pointers Assignment Repository

This repository contains solutions for a series of C programming assignments focused on understanding and implementing pointers. Each assignment demonstrates different aspects of pointer usage in C, including basic pointer operations, pointer arithmetic, passing pointers to functions, double pointers, and string manipulation with character pointers.

## Repository Structure
- `src/assignment1.c`: Basics of Pointers
- `src/assignment2.c`: Pointer Arithmetic
- `src/assignment3.c`: Pointers and Functions
- `src/assignment4.c`: Pointers to Pointers
- `src/assignment5.c`: Strings and Character Pointers
- `report.md`: Detailed analysis of each program, including code explanations and observations about pointer behavior
- `README.md`: This file

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone  https://github.com/RealGevorgian/pointers_assignment.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd pointers_assignment`
3. Compile each C file using a C compiler, e.g., `gcc src/assignment1.c -o assignment1`
4. Run the executable: `./assignment1`

## Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of C programming and pointers
